This is a [Factorio](http://www.factorio.com/) mod. It lets you keep track of
your mining sites and warns you when they're starting to run low.

## Many thanks for ##

* The major effort by drs9999 to create
[the original Resource Monitor](http://www.factorioforums.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=86&t=2855).

[the 0.12 unofficial update](http://www.factorioforums.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=120&t=13809).

members of the #factorio IRC on espernet.
